!!!!PROJECT IS INCOMPLETE!!!!

This project was created in React

- Loads a random JSON file

- Typing into the search bar it looks for matching values within the name, phone number and address

- Ascending/Descending button does not operate yet.
When replacing "loaded" (App.js line 75) with "filteredAndSortedAsc" (App.js line 49) or "filteredAndSortedDesc" (App.js line 58), it sorts data by name alphabetically (asc/desc).
